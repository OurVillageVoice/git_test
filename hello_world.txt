Add README.md to the staging area with git add README.md.

Can you guess what git status will output now? README.md will be 
displayed in green text in the section titled “Changes to be 
committed”. That means README.md has been added to the staging area. 
The file hello_world.txt will not show up because it has not been 
modified since it was committed.

Open hello_world.txt, add some text to it, save it and stage it. You 
can use git add . to add all files in the current directory and all 
subsequent directories to the staging area. Then, type git status 
once more, and everything should now be in the staging area.

Finally, let’s commit all of the files that are in the staging area 
and add a descriptive commit message. git commit -m "Edit README.md 
and hello_world.txt". Then, type git status once again, which will 
output the same “nothing to commit” message as when we previously 
made a commit.
